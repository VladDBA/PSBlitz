# PSBlitz
Since I'm a big fan of [Brent Ozar's](https://www.brentozar.com/) [SQL Server First Responder Kit](https://github.com/BrentOzarULTD/SQL-Server-First-Responder-Kit) and I've found myself in situations where I would have liked a quick way of easily exporting the output of sp_Blitz, sp_BlitzCache, sp_BlitzFirst, sp_BlitzIndex, sp_BlitzLock, and sp_BlitzWho, to Excel and saving to disk execution plans identified by sp_BlitzCache and deadlock graphs from sp_BlitzLock.
